title: Vendor pricelists
---

## Where to find

Forms for working with pricelists are usually located at **“Purchase” → “Operations” → “Pricelists”**.

## Purpose

A **pricelist** stores [vendor](../masterdata/partners.md) prices and is used for:

- preparing purchase prices;
- filling in prices when creating [purchase orders](orders.md);
- recording price changes by periods.

## Pricelist structure

In a pricelist, you typically specify:

- [vendor](../masterdata/partners.md);
- validity period (start/end date);
- note.

### Pricelist lines

In lines, you specify:

- [item](../masterdata/items.md);
- price;
- if needed — vendor name/SKU (if you maintain mapping).

## Comments and history

The pricelist card may contain a comment feed:

- add comments to record agreements and the source of prices;
- view the date/time and author of comments.

## Copying a pricelist

If you need to quickly create a new pricelist based on a previous one (for example, for a new period), use copying:

- a new pricelist is created;
- header fields and lines are copied;
- then you can update the validity period and adjust prices.
