## Purchase orders report

The purchase orders report allows you to analyze purchase orders by:

- [vendors](../masterdata/partners.md);
- statuses;
- dates;
- [items](../masterdata/items.md) and categories (if classification is used);
- purchase order fields (type, [payment terms](../invoicing/settings.md#payment-terms), Scheduled date, etc.).

### Date filters

As a rule, the report provides:

- a date interval;
- grouping by day/week/month/year (if the corresponding report variants are enabled).

### What to use it for

The report is useful for:

- controlling “what has been ordered” and “from whom it has been ordered”;
- analyzing scheduled delivery dates;
- preparing reconciliations with vendors.
