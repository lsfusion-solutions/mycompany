The **“Fleet”** section uses directories that define selection options in vehicle, service, and contract cards.

## Where to find it

Usually it is available under **“Fleet” → “Configuration”**.

Access to configuration is typically restricted by administrator permissions or by the person responsible for directories.

## Section configuration

The **“Configuration”** screen contains tabs with directories. The availability of tabs depends on the configuration.

Typical directories:

- **Fuel types** — options for the “Fuel type” field in the vehicle card.
- **Vehicle categories** — vehicle classification (for example, passenger cars, trucks, special equipment).
- **Vehicle service types** — service classification (scheduled maintenance, repair, etc.).
- **Vehicle tags** — additional labels for filtering and control.

For directories, the **New**, **Edit**, **Delete** actions are usually available.

Recommendations for maintaining directories:

- agree on unified naming (without duplicates and different spellings of the same value);
- use clear names so users can quickly select the required option;
- if the directory has a “Code” field, fill it consistently (often used for integrations and data exchange).

## Vehicle manufacturers and models

Directories may be available separately:

- **Vehicle manufacturers**;
- **Vehicle models**.

Recommended filling order:

1. Create manufacturers first.
2. Then add models selecting the manufacturer.

Practical tip: if your organization has many similar models, it is convenient to follow a single format (for example, “Manufacturer / Model”) — it simplifies search and avoids duplicates.
