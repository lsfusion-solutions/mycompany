title: Invoices for orders
---

An [invoice](../invoicing/invoices.md) records a sale in accounting terms: revenue, taxes, and totals.

## Where to find

Usually available in **“Sales” → “Operations”** (or in the “Invoicing”/“Accounting” section — depending on configuration).

## Relation to an order

An invoice can be created based on a sales order and/or a shipment.

When created, it typically transfers:

- [customer](../masterdata/partners.md);
- [location](../inventory/locations.md) and/or address;
- lines and quantities (from the order or from the actual shipment);
- prices, discounts, and taxes.

## Typical scenario

1. Make sure the order is confirmed.
2. Create an invoice for the order (or for the shipment, if configured).
3. Check amounts and taxes.
4. Post the document.
