The “Settings” section contains parameters and directories that define Human Resources behavior: recruitment statuses and rules, attendance parameters, and payroll calculation/payment parameters.

Available settings depend on your organization configuration and user permissions.

## Recruitment

Typically configured:

- **application statuses** (order, color, “prohibit editing” flag, closing flags);
- **refuse reasons**;
- **email templates** for candidate communication;
- connecting a mailbox for automatic processing of incoming application messages (if used).

Recommendation: agree in advance on a single status scheme and rules for who changes application status and when.

## Attendance

Typically configured:

- whether attendance without geolocation is allowed;
- kiosk parameters (including photo usage);
- badge print templates (if badges are used).

## Payroll: calculation and payment

Typically configured:

- **calculation types** (e.g., earnings and deductions);
- payslip batch generation parameters;
- payment type used when registering payments by payslips (if your organization registers payments in the system).
