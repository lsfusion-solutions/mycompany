title: Recruitment
---

The “Recruitment” section is used to work with candidates: registering applications, storing files (resume, etc.), planning interviews, and recording decisions.

## Main objects

### Application

An application typically includes:

- creation date;
- subject and description (brief summary/comments);
- candidate contact details (e.g., email address);
- position;
- department;
- recruiter (responsible owner);
- expected and offered salary;
- availability;
- tags (for classification);
- application files.

An application moves through statuses. Status set, order and available actions depend on your organization settings.

### Interview

An interview is used to record a recruitment stage:

- participants are specified;
- a summary/result is filled.

## Typical scenarios

### Create an application manually

1. Open **“Human Resources” → “Operations” → “Applications”**.
2. Create an application.
3. Fill key details: position, department, recruiter, contact details, description.
4. If needed, set expected/offered salary and availability.
5. Attach candidate files.

### Attach materials to an application

You can store files (e.g., resume) and comments in the application:

1. Open the candidate application.
2. Add files.
3. Add a comment if needed.

### Schedule an interview

1. Open the application.
2. Run **“Schedule an interview”**.
3. Select participants.
4. After the interview, fill the **summary** (brief notes and next steps).

### Write an email to a candidate

If email sending is configured, you can write an email from the application:

1. Open the application.
2. Run **“Write an email”**.
3. If templates exist, select a template — subject and body will be filled automatically.
4. Send the email.

### Hire a candidate

Use “Hire” when you decided to hire:

1. Open the application.
2. Run **“Hire”**.
3. Review the created employee card and fill missing data (if required).
4. Make sure the application status is moved to “Hired”.

### Refuse a candidate

1. Open the application.
2. Run **“Refuse”**.
3. Select a **refuse reason**.
4. If needed, send an email to the candidate (manually or by template, if configured).
5. Make sure the application status is moved to “Refused”.

## Control and convenience

To speed up work, usually used:

- filters and groupings by status and position;
- tags for quick classification;
- change history and comments.
