title: Activities

The **“Activities”** section is used to plan and track tasks, meetings, calls, and other actions.

## Activities and Types

Every activity has a **Type** (e.g., Call, Meeting, Task). The type determines which fields are available and required. For example, some types may require start and end times, while others only need a date.

## Creating an Activity

To create a new activity:
1. Open the **Activities** section.
2. Select the required **Type** from the buttons at the top.
3. In the activity window, fill in the details:
   - **Type**: Selected automatically, but can be changed.
   - **Name**: A brief description or title of the activity.
   - **Due date**: The planned completion date. It defaults to 7 days from today.
   - **Time** and **Till**: Start and end times (if enabled for the selected type).
   - **Assigned to**: The employee responsible for the activity. It defaults to the current user.
   - **Attendees**: Partners who will participate in the activity.
   - **Object**: A link to a related document or record (e.g., a specific Lead or Order).
   - **Description**: Detailed information about what needs to be done.

## Working with the Activity List

The **Activities** form provides a convenient view of all tasks:
- **Calendar and List**: You can see activities both in a list and on a calendar.
- **Filters**: By default, only **Opened** activities are shown. You can also filter by **Type**, **Assigned to**, or **Attendee**.
- **Navigation**: You can jump directly to the linked **Object** using the link in the activity list.

## Completing an Activity

When you finish a task:
1. Click the **Done** button.
2. In the feedback window, enter the results of the activity (**Feedback**).
3. The activity will be marked as completed.

Completed activities are highlighted in the list and are hidden when the "Opened" filter is active.

## Activities in Other Records

Activities can be managed directly from the cards of other objects (like Leads or Partners):
- You can see a list of related activities on a dedicated tab.
- The list shows the type, due date, status, and how many days are left to complete the task.
- A badge on the tab shows the number of pending activities.
- When an activity is completed, a comment with the description and feedback may be automatically added to the record's history.
