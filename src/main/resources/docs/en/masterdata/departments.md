title: Departments
---

The **“Departments”** directory is used to maintain branches/locations/structural units linked to a partner. A department is convenient when one partner has multiple addresses or places of work.

## Department card

Typical fields:

- **ID** (can be generated automatically);
- **Name**;
- **Address** (street/house, etc.);
- **City**;
- **State**;
- **Postcode**.

## Use in documents

If a document allows selecting a department, the system may check consistency: the department must belong to the same partner as specified in the document.

If the selected department is cleared after changing the partner in the document, this is expected behavior to avoid errors.
