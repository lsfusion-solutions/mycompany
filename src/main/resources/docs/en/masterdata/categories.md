title: Categories
---

The **“Categories”** directory is used to group items. Categories can be hierarchical (a tree): a category can have a parent category.

## List and tree

Two views are usually available:

- **List** — a flat list of categories;
- **Tree** — a hierarchy of categories.

## Category card

Typical fields:

- **Name**;
- **ID** (can be generated automatically);
- **Parent category** (if hierarchy is used);
- **Archived**.

## Creating a subcategory

To create a subcategory, select the parent category and create a new entry specifying the parent.

## Restrictions

If a category is used in other categories (as a parent) or in items, deletion may be forbidden. In this case, use archiving.
