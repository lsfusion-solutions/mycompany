title: Countries

The **“Countries”** directory is used for partner addresses and other objects where a country must be specified.

## Country card

Typical fields:

- **ID**;
- **Name**;
- if needed — **Alpha‑2** and **Alpha‑3** codes.

## Recommendations

- Use a single country directory for the whole system to avoid duplicates.
