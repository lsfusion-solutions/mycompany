title: Lots and printing
---

In manufacturing, lots and printing forms can be used.

## Lots

A lot allows you to link production output and subsequent stock movements to a specific production batch.

If your configuration has lot tracking enabled:

- you can specify a lot on production output;
- you can print labels for a lot;
- lots are used for traceability.

## Printing

Printing forms may be available in a [manufacturing order](orders.md) (for example, a production job/order form).

If printing is available:

1. Open the [manufacturing order](orders.md).
2. Select the required print form.
3. Verify key fields are filled in (item, quantity, dates).
