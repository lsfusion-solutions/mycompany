title: Manufacturing settings and directories
---

## Location

Open **“Manufacturing”** → **“Settings”** → **“Settings”**.

## Manufacturing order statuses

The settings include a directory of manufacturing order statuses.

What is important:

- the **“Read-only”** flag makes the order non-editable in this status;
- statuses affect which actions are available (reservation, start, completion).

## Manufacturing order types

The settings include a directory of manufacturing order types. Typically, a type defines:

- name and identifier;
- numerators (number generation);
- material location;
- unbuild flag;
- **Scrap type**.

If only one type exists, it is used as the default.

## Recommended setup order

1. Create manufacturing order types.
2. Configure numerators and material locations.
3. Configure statuses and edit permissions.
4. If needed, configure the **Scrap type**.
