title: Refunds and corrections
---

In “Invoicing”, documents may be available to correct obligations:

- refund;
- correction document.

Document names and the exact set depend on configuration.

## When to use

- if you need to decrease a previously issued amount;
- if goods were returned;
- if you need to correct [taxes](taxes.md) or amounts.

## Relationship with original documents

Refund/correction documents are typically linked:

- to an [invoice](invoices.md);
- to a [contract](../masterdata/contracts.md);
- to [payments](payments.md) (when money is returned).
