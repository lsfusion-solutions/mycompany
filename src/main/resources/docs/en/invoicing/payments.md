# Payments

Payments in **“Invoicing”** are divided into two types:

- **incoming** — money received from a partner;
- **outgoing** — money paid to a partner.

Detailed instructions are provided on separate pages:

- [Incoming payments](incoming-payments.md)
- [Outgoing payments](outgoing-payments.md)

## Printing

If print forms are connected in your configuration, payments can be printed.
