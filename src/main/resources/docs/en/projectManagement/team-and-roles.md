title: Team and roles on a project
---

This page describes how to work with project participants: teams, roles, and assignments.

It is recommended to maintain the team and roles from the first days of the project: this simplifies task assignment, workload control, and participation reporting.

## Team

A team is a separate list of employees that can be assigned **to multiple projects at the same time**.

This is convenient when the same group works on different projects or on several areas within the organization.

Important considerations:

- if you add/remove an employee from a team, the list of employees assigned to the project will change **in all projects** where this team is assigned;
- if participation period matters, specify participation dates in the project assignment (see the “Assignments” section).

#### How to assign a team to a project

Assigning a team is done via the **assignments** list in the project card.

1. Open the required project.
2. Go to the assignments section (project participants list).
3. Add a new assignment.
4. In the participant field, select a **team** (not an individual employee).
5. If needed, specify the role and participation period (start/end dates).
6. Save the changes.

After saving, all employees included in the selected team will be considered project participants (taking into account the participation period and your access permissions).

#### What happens when the team composition changes

If a team is already assigned to a project and you change its composition:

- new employees will appear in the project assignment list;
- removed employees will no longer be considered assigned (if there are no other assignments for them to this project).

It is recommended to coordinate team composition changes with the project manager and record reasons in project or task comments.

## Project roles

A project role reflects a participant’s function (for example, manager, assignee, observer — the exact list depends on configuration). Roles are used for:

- separating responsibilities;
- configuring access (if provided);
- analytics on employee participation.

Recommendations:

- agree on the meaning of roles in advance (what “assignee”, “observer”, etc. mean);
- if roles affect access permissions, change roles consciously and in agreement.

## Assignments

An assignment links an employee to a project (and, if needed, to tasks) and records participation terms.

An assignment often includes:

- participant;
- role;
- participation period (start/end dates);
- additional terms (if used in the organization).

It is recommended to keep assignments up to date:

- add participants when work starts;
- close assignments when an employee no longer participates;
- align team roles with actual responsibilities.

## Typical scenarios

#### Project start

1. Assign the project manager.
2. Form the initial team composition.
3. Assign roles (if used).
4. Create tasks and assign assignees from the team.

#### Adding a new participant

1. Add the employee to the project team.
2. Assign a role.
3. Provide context: project description, current tasks, and status rules.
4. Assign tasks and due dates.

#### Replacing an assignee on a task

1. Clarify the reason for replacement and leave a comment on the task.
2. Assign the new assignee.
3. Check due dates and dependencies.
4. If needed, adjust the plan and inform the team.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Why a task cannot be assigned to an employee

The reason is usually one of the following:

- the employee is not added to the project team (if control is enabled);
- you do not have permission to change the team/assignments;
- the selected task type restricts the list of assignees.
