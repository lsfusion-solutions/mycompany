This page describes effort tracking via time entries: why it is needed, how to enter records correctly, and how to handle typical errors.

## Why time entries are needed

Time entries allow you to:

- record actual time spent on tasks and projects;
- form data for effort reporting;
- compare planned expectations with actuals and improve planning.

In addition to managerial control, time entries are often used for internal reporting and employee workload analysis.

## How to add a time entry

Typical scenario:

1. Open the project or task for which you need to record time.
2. Create a new time entry.
3. Specify the date and number of hours (and other fields if they are used in your organization).
4. Save the record.

#### Filling recommendations

- record time as it happens, as close as possible to the work date;
- do not “accumulate” time entries until the end of the month — this increases the risk of mistakes;
- if you worked on several tasks, record time as separate entries;
- if your organization uses time entry types, choose the type that matches the nature of the work.

## Checks and restrictions

Depending on configuration, restrictions may apply:

- you cannot add a time entry without a selected project or task;
- you cannot add a time entry if the task belongs to another project;
- you cannot enter time for past dates if the period is closed (if period control is used in the organization).

## Common situations

#### Cannot add a time entry

Check:

- that the project/task for tracking is selected;
- that the user has permission to create time entries;
- that the input period is not closed by accounting rules (if period control is used).

#### Message “Project is not selected”

This usually means the time entry is created without linking it to a project or a task.

What to do:

1. Open the required project or task.
2. Create the time entry from the project/task card.
3. If you enter the time entry from the general list, explicitly select the project and/or task.

#### Message about a task project mismatch

If the time entry is linked to a task that belongs to another project, the system may forbid saving.

What to do:

- check which project the task belongs to;
- if needed, fix the project on the task or select the correct task.
