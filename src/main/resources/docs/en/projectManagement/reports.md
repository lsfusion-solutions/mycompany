title: Reporting

This page describes typical reporting options for projects, tasks, and effort. The exact set of reports and metrics depends on configuration.

## Why project reporting is needed

Reporting helps to:

- control progress by projects and tasks;
- see due date deviations;
- analyze effort by projects, tasks, and participants;
- find bottlenecks (employee overload, blocking dependencies, overdue items).

## Typical reports and dimensions

#### By projects

Typical questions:

- list of active projects;
- projects with approaching due dates;
- projects without tasks or without a team (if a team is maintained).

#### By tasks

Typical questions:

- tasks by **[statuses](settings.md#task-statuses)** (in progress, waiting, completed);
- overdue tasks;
- tasks without an assignee;
- tasks blocked by dependencies.

#### By effort

Typical questions:

- effort by projects for a period;
- effort by tasks for a period;
- effort by employees for a period;
- “plan vs actual” comparison (if effort planning is used in the organization).

## Recommended control routine

#### Daily

- the team updates **[task statuses](settings.md#task-statuses)**;
- assignees record **[time entries](time-entries.md)**.

#### Weekly

- the project manager checks overdue items and priorities;
- clarifies dependencies and blocks;
- reviews due dates for upcoming tasks.

#### After project completion

- move the project to a closed status;
- record results and key decisions in comments/description;
- prepare a final effort report.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Why the effort report “does not match”

Check:

- whether all participants entered **[time entries](time-entries.md)** for the period;
- whether time was entered to the wrong project or task;
- whether time entry is restricted for a closed period;
- whether the report period is selected correctly.
