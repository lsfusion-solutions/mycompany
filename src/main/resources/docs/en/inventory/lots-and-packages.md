## Lots

A lot (batch/serial) is used for traceability.

If lot accounting is enabled:

- a lot can be specified in [receipts](receipts.md);
- a lot can be required in [shipments](shipments.md);
- [stock reports](reports-and-ledgers.md) can be built with a lot breakdown.

## Packages

A package is used to account for goods in containers/packaging units.

If package accounting is enabled:

- you can account for package contents;
- you can link a package to a lot;
- you can perform [transfer](transfers.md)/[shipment](shipments.md) operations using packages.
