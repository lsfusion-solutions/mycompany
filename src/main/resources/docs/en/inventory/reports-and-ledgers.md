title: Reports and ledgers
---

The Inventory reporting section typically includes reports and ledgers.

## Reports

Most commonly used:

- stock on hand report;
- inventory valuation;
- item movements;
- [costing reports](costing.md).

## Ledgers

The system may provide ledgers:

- stock ledger;
- reservation ledger;
- cost ledger.

Practical purpose of ledgers:

- explain where a balance comes from;
- show movement history;
- help find the cause of variances.

## Recommendations

1. Always set a date interval when analyzing movements.
2. For problematic items, use breakdown by [location](locations.md) and [lot](lots-and-packages.md).
