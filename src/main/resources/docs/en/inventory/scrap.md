title: Scrap
---

Scrap is used to record stock decreases for reasons not related to sales:

- damage;
- losses;
- defects;
- expiry;
- internal consumption.

## Typical scenario

1. Create a scrap document.
2. Specify the [location](locations.md).
3. Fill lines: item, quantity, reason (if used).
4. Complete the document.

## Relationship with other modules

Scrap can be created based on other documents (for example, a production order, if the corresponding scenario is enabled).
