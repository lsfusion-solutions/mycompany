## Where to find it

Open **“Inventory” → “Operations” → “Receipts”**.

## Purpose

A receipt records goods coming into a [location](locations.md).

The document is used to:

- record planned and actual quantities to receive;
- receive goods into a specific [location](locations.md);
- if needed — put goods away into zones/bins (bin-level storage);
- create stock movements and (if enabled) costing movements.

## Receipt list

The list typically shows:

- number;
- planned date and time;
- receipt type;
- supplier (if used);
- [location](locations.md);
- note;
- line count.

Actions are also available: create, open, delete (if allowed by status and permissions).

## Receipt card

### Header fields

In the header you typically fill:

- **Type** — affects numbering, default [location](locations.md) and constraints;
- **Planned date** — planned receiving time;
- **Number** — generated by a numbering rule;
- **Supplier** (if used);
- **Location** — required;
- **Supplier reference** (e.g., supplier delivery note number — if used);
- **Note**.

Practical tip: select type and [location](locations.md) first — then it is easier to add lines.

### Receipt lines

Lines contain items and quantities.

Typical line fields:

- **Item** — required;
- **UoM** — taken from the item;
- **Barcode** (if used);
- **Internal code** (if used);
- **Reference/SKU** (if used).

#### “Planned quantity” field

For receipts that are not executed immediately, the **“Planned quantity”** field is used:

- it is the planned quantity for the line;
- the field can be highlighted in draft to remind to fill it.

Constraint:

- the value must be between `0` and the **maximum quantity** defined in the receipt type;
- if exceeded, the document cannot be saved.

#### “One line per item” constraint

For some receipt types, a rule can be enabled:

- the same item cannot be added in two lines;
- when adding a duplicate, the system shows an error.

## Statuses and stages

Below is the status set **as it follows from the source code**.

1. **Draft** — data entry.
2. **Ready** — the document is marked for execution.
3. **Done** — the receipt is confirmed; completion date is recorded.
4. **Put away** — put-away into child locations.
   - available **only if** the receipt type enables put-away;
   - the system checks that the target [location](locations.md) is a child of the document location and that the total put away does not exceed the received quantity.
5. **Canceled** — the document is Canceled.

### Moving from Draft to “Ready”

In the receipt card, an action **“Mark as Todo”** is available to move the document from **Draft** to **Ready** (in practice: move it to execution).

The receipt list can also provide a bulk action **“Mark as Todo”** to move several selected receipts to **Ready**.

## Put away (bin-level storage)

If bin-level storage is used, after receiving you perform put-away into bins.

Recommendation: complete the receipt first (confirm the fact), then do put-away — this makes variances easier to control.

## Typical issues

- **Cannot save a line** — “Planned quantity” is out of the limits defined in the receipt type.
- **Cannot add the same item in a second line** — “one line per item” is enabled in the receipt type.
- **Cannot complete** — [location](locations.md) is missing or there are lines without quantity.
- **Actual quantities do not match** — check line input and units of measure.
