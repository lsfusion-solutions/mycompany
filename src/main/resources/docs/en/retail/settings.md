# Retail settings

This page describes the basic settings that affect how the cash register and POS work.

## Where to find it

Settings are usually located in **“Retail” → “Settings”**.

In most configurations, the main directories (cash registers, payment methods, discount cards) are available directly from this section.

## Cash registers

A cash register is a workplace from which sales and returns are processed.

Where to find: usually **“Retail” → “Settings” → “Cash registers”**.

Typically configured:

- cash register **name** and **code**;
- **company**;
- linking the cash register to a **computer** (so that a specific computer suggests “its” cash register).

## Sessions

Sessions usually use numbering. A session numeration parameter may be available in settings.

## Payment methods

Settings define the list of payment methods. For each method, you typically specify:

Where to find: usually **“Retail” → “Settings” → “Payment methods”**.

- name and code;
- the **“cash”** flag (used to calculate change);
- mapping to financial payment types (if the financial contour is used).

## Discount cards

Discount cards may use automatic numbering. A discount card numeration parameter may be available in settings.

Where to find: usually **“Retail” → “Settings” → “Discount cards”**.

## Marked goods

If your configuration uses marked goods:

- mandatory scanning can be configured per category;
- the code validation mode can be configured (online/offline);
- for offline validation, you may need to specify a local module for the cash register.
