This page describes the basic settings that affect how the **[cash register](pos.md)** and **[POS](pos.md)** work.

## Where to find it

Settings are usually located in **“Retail” → “Configuration” → “Settings”**.

In most configurations, the main directories (cash registers, payment methods, discount cards) are available directly from this section.

## Cash registers

A cash register is a workplace from which sales and returns are processed.

Where to find: usually **“Retail” → “Configuration” → “Cash registers”**.

Typically configured:

- cash register **name** and **code**;
- **company**;
- linking the cash register to a **computer** (so that a specific computer suggests “its” cash register).

## Sessions

**[Sessions](sessions.md)** usually use numbering. A session numeration parameter may be available in settings.

## Payment methods

Settings define the list of payment methods (see also: **[Retail payments](payments.md)**). For each method, you typically specify:

Where to find: usually **“Retail” → “Configuration” → “Settings”** (Payment methods tab).

- name and code;
- the **“cash”** flag (used to calculate change);
- mapping to financial payment types (if the financial contour is used).

## Discount cards

**[Discount cards](discount-cards.md)** may use automatic numbering. A discount card numeration parameter may be available in settings.

Where to find: usually **“Retail” → “Configuration” → “Discount cards”**.
