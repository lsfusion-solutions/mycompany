A session is the period of **[cash register](settings.md)** operation between opening and closing. Sales and returns in **[POS](pos.md)** are processed within an open session.

## Where to find it

**“Retail” → “Operations” → “Sessions”**.

## How to open a session

1. Open the session list.
2. Select a **[cash register](settings.md)**.
3. Run the **“Open session”** action.

The system automatically records the date and time of opening.

### Restrictions

- You cannot open a session if there is already an open session for the selected cash register.

## How to close a session

1. Open the session you want to close.
2. Run the **“Close session”** action and confirm.

The system records the date and time of closing.

### Restrictions

- A session cannot be closed earlier than it was opened.

## Monitoring operations by session

In the session list, filtering by date is usually available. In **[POS](pos.md)**, you can usually view the receipt list:

- by the current session;
- by cash register.
